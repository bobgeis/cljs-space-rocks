## Considerations


## JS vs CLJS vs Elm


## Architecture


## Dependencies


## Things Learned

* SVGs look nicer than canvas (in my opinion).

* At least in the naive implementation, large numbers of SVGs perform worse than canvas.

* It isn't necessary to specify a z-index to make html appear on top of the svg (contrast with canvas, where it sometimes was necessary).


## To Do

### Needed

* FTL Flashes

* Escape Pods

* Ships

* Ship Timer Spawn

* Rock-Ship Interaction

* Edge & Fizzbuzz Drawing

### Wanted

* Tests & CI

* Hooligans

* More efficient use of CSS & SVG for repetition and animation

### Bugs

* Performance in Firefox and slower computers?
