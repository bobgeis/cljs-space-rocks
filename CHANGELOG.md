This is a learning project, so take the "versions" with a grain of salt.


## [0.1.1] 2018-

* The game SVG scales to the size of the browser window.
* The SVG coordinate system has been changed to allow rounding of decimals values to integers.  This should make the total SVG smaller.
* Time travel can now be done in increments of less than 13 seconds.  Hold Z to play the timeline in reverse and release Z to jump to that moment.  Press X during playback to abort the jump.
* Some game objects near the edge of the play area now wrap (appear on both sides).
* Added traveling ships to protect.
* Traveler ships can drop escape pods that, like the gems dropped by rocks, the player can catch.
* Added a hospital station that the escape pods can be delivered to.
* Rocks will spawn more quickly as more ships transit the play area successfully.
* Ships will spawn more quickly as the player delivers more gems or pods to their respective stations.
* Ships now have svg emblems
* Updated thoughts markdown files.
